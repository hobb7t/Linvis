About this Project
(Lin)kedIn (Vis)itor is a simple Python-based automation tool that uses Selenium to:

- Log into LinkedIn and search for profiles based on specified keywords, then visit profiles automatically up to a specified number of pages.
It helps developers explore browser automation and Selenium scripting while adhering to ethical guidelines and LinkedIn's Terms of Service.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Automating interactions on LinkedIn may violate their Terms of Service. Use responsibly, and avoid scraping sensitive information. 
By using this tool, you take full responsibility for complying with LinkedIn's policies.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Automated Login: The program checks if you're already logged in, skipping redundant logins.
Profile Search and Visit: Automatically searches for profiles using a keyword and visits them.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles slow-loading pages and unexpected issues.
Dependency Installation: Automatically installs missing Python libraries.
Customizable: Easily edit keywords, page limits, and behavior. (Sooner or later, a GUI will come out)

üñ•Ô∏è How to Use
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher is required.
Install Google Chrome (latest version) and ensure chromedriver is available.
Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hobb7t/Linvis.git
cd Linvis

Run the program:

bash

The script will:

Check your Python version.
Automatically install any missing dependencies (selenium, webdriver-manager).
Prompt for LinkedIn login credentials, search keywords, and the number of pages to visit. 
(Due to security implementations, the username and pass are not saved on a file, are just being sent to memory for as long you are using the program)
